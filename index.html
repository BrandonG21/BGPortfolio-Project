                Hi! My name is Brandon Greaux. I like to spend my free time playing sports and building computers.
                I am 23 years old and I am currently enrolled in the UCF Coding BootCamp. 
                This bootcamp is designed to teach students the fundementals of coding in around 6 months.
                I joined the bootcamp mostly for my love for computers to continue diving further into the tech world.
                I am contiuing to develop my skills and projects outside of the bootcamp 
                and hope to continue to learn more about coding throughout my journey.
